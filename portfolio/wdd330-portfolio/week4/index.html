      <p>Notes for week 4:</p>
      <p>
        I Decided to look at the Code Sandbox this week and check out some
        excercises. <br />
        There are a lot of interesting ones. I checked out chapter 6 and 10 like
        the reading suggested. <br />
        From what I was looking at everything was reminding me heavily of
        Python, which is where I have most of my coding knowledge. <br />
        There were a lot of excercises that helped me look at how a class works.
        I got used to using class's in Python but it is good to see the
        differences between the two. <br />
        Similarly to python you define a class by using a class declaration. You
        use the "class" keyword, that was no surprise.<br />
        Followed by the class keyword you then simply type the pnjame of the
        class. Ex: class Myclass {}<br />
        Something to Note with classes, unlike function declarations where you
        can call it in the code, a class must be put before the code otherwise
        you get a "ReferenceError"<br />
        <br />
        you can also use "class expressions" to call a class.<br />
        classes can be names or unnamed, and the given names are local. But they
        can be accessed through the <strong>name</strong> property.<br />
        Here is an example from developer.mozilla.org where I spent some extra
        time studying the topic.<br />
        <p style="color:red;">// unnamed</p><br />
        let Rectangle = class {<br />
        constructor(height, width) {<br />
        this.height = height;<br />
        this.width = width;<br />
        }<br />
        };<br />
        console.log(Rectangle.name);<br />
        // output: "Rectangle"<br />
        <br />
        <p style="color:red;">// named</p><br />
        let Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {<br />
        constructor(height, width) {<br />
        this.height = height;<br />
        this.width = width;<br />
        }<br />
        };<br />
        console.log(Rectangle.name);<br />
        // output: "Rectangle2"<br />
      </p>
      <br />
      Here are some definitions I found useful:<br />
      These are all from developer.mozilla.org<br>
      "The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {}. This is
      where you define class members, such as methods or constructor."<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Strict mode</strong><br />
      The body of a class is executed in strict mode, i.e., code written here is
      subject to stricter syntax for increased performance, some otherwise
      silent errors will be thrown, and certain keywords are reserved for future
      versions of ECMAScript.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Constructor</strong><br />
      The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing
      an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with
      the name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the
      class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.<br />
      <br />
      A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the
      super class.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Static initialization blocks</strong><br />
      Class static initialization blocks allow flexible initialization of class
      static properties including the evaluation of statements during
      initialization, and granting access to private scope.<br />
      <br />
      Multiple static blocks can be declared, and these can be interleaved with
      the declaration of static properties and methods (all static items are
      evaluated in declaration order).<br />
