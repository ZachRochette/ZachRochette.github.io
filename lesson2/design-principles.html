        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

        <img src="images/WDD-simply-chocolate.jpg" alt="Simply Chocolate Home Page">
        <p>Simply Chocolate does a great job of showing Visual Hierarchy. The way their page is set up allows the user to naviagte smoothly
        through the page. On the home page it takes the users attention and focuses it towards the product, and it does this without taking 
        away from other elements on the screen. This same effortless navigation is present on every screen in the page. The result is a pleasent
        browsing experience witht the webpage almost guiding you through the website.</p>

        <h2>Fitts' Law</h2>
        <p><span class="business">Circleci</span><br>
        <a href="https://circleci.com/">circleci.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/WDD-circleci.jpg" alt="CircleCi Home Page">
        <p>Circleci is a good example of Fitts' Law because because I believe that it centers its call to action buttons and makes them the most
        prominent buttons on the screen. It tells the user "Hey clcik me!". Fitts' Law was designed to pull the users attention to certain points on 
        the screen such as call to action buttons. I can see this website implementing that with their buttons and that is why I think this website 
        is a good example of Fitts' Law. </p>

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <p><span class="business">Quip</span><br>
        <a href="https://www.getquip.com/">getquip.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/WDD-quip.jpg" alt="Healthline mobile view">
        <p>Quip is a website that sells toothbrushes, and I believe it does a wonderful job at using White Space and Clean Design. On the home page
        you see pictures that rotate on behind the name of the sight, and these images explain what Quip is and what they sell. Thats it, all you need 
        is the product name and the images behind it and you can tell exactly what this company is about and what they do. I think that is a great use 
        of White Space and Clean Design. It's not cluttered and it gets its point across.</p>
