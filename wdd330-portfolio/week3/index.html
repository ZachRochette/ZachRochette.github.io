      <p>Notes for week 3:</p>
      <p>
        Something that I thought was interesting was the
        <strong>This</strong> keyword. <br />
        The <strong>This</strong> keyword allows us to acces an object. <br />
        Here is an example of the <strong>This</strong> keyword in action.
        <br />
        let user = { <br />
        name: "John",<br />
        age: 30,<br />
        <br />
        sayHi() {<br />
        <!-- "this" is the "current object"<br /> -->
        alert(this.name);<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        };<br />
        <br />
        user.sayHi(); // John<br />
        In this example the value of <strong>This</strong> will be "user".<br />
        The value of <strong>This</strong> is evaluated during the run-time,
        depending on the context.<br />
        <br />
        Something else I enjoyed reading about was events in JavaScript.<br />
        An even is essentially just something that happens to HTML elements.<br />
        We can use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS elements.<br />
        There are several easy ways to make events happen.<br />
        One of them is onclick, like when you click a button something will
        happen. Example code looks like this:<br />
        <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
          The time is?
        </button>
        "button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML =
        Date()">The time is? "button"<br />
        Replace the "button" for the actual button tag of course. <br />
        More HTML events include: <br />
        <li>onchange</li>
        <li>onclick</li>
        <li>onmouseover</li>
        <li>onmouseout</li>
        <li>onkeydown</li>
        <li>onload</li>
        I actually didn't know about most of these, I'm excited to try some of
        them out.<br />
