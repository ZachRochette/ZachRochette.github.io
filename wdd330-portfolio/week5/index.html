      <p>Notes for week 5:</p>
      <p>
        So I don't have a lot of experience with debugging. <br />
        That is why I studied that a lot this week. <br />
        I feel like most people thing that debugging is pretty easy, but there
        is a lot that goes into if you want to do it well. <br />
        You can use <strong>console.log()</strong> to display JavaScript in the
        debugger window.<br />
        You can use the keyword <strong>debugger</strong> to stop JavaScript
        execution and call the debugging function. <br />
        It is similar to a breakpoint.<br />
        Example: (From W3schools)<br />) let x = 15 * 5;<br />
        debugger;<br />
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;<br />
        Some debugging tools from my browser. (Chrome)<br />
        Chrome<br />
        Open the browser.<br />
        From the menu, select "More tools".<br />
        From tools, choose "Developer tools".<br />
        Finally, select Console. <br />
        I already knew this but it doesn't hurt to have a reminder I suppose.
